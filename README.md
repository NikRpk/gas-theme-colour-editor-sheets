# Theme Colour Editor - Google Add-On

The aim of this add-on is to allow you to set the custom colours in your Google Sheet quickly and save these colours across all of your worksheets so that you don't have to manually input hexadecimal numbers each time you want to style a new sheet! 

Please find the complete code used to create this add-on in the files in this repository. Feel free to copy or adapt it to fit your own custom needs. 

I have only released this within my organisation and not as a public add-on. You can quite easily do this for your own organisation or also as a public addon if you want.

1. "Set theme colours" -> Use this to set theme colours of the sheet to the default ones that you have saved (can be custom to your profile)
2. "Edit theme colours" -> Edit the default theme colours. These will be saved in the addon and can be accessed in all future sheets. These do not set the default colours for all sheets, you will have trigger "Set theme colours" for that. 
3. "Reset to default" -> Set the default theme colours to the ones provided by the add-on on install
4. "Help" -> redirects to the GitHub page where you can raise an isssue and I will address it. 

# Frequently Asked Questions 

If you do not find your issue here, please raise an issue [here](https://github.com/NikRpk/GoogleScripts/issues/new/choose) and I will try to answer it as fast as possible. 

#### Nothing happens when I click on "Save colours & Change Theme"
The most common reason is that you are logged into multiple google accounts and are currently using one that is not the default. 
   1. You could log out of all accounts and only log into one account. 
   2. You could open the sheet using your main account.

#### A new sheet does not have the right colours set
The addon does not do this automatically. You will have to click on "Set theme colours" in the addon menu to do this. 

#### The initial colours are weird
These are just the default colours and you can update these. If you do update these (see the menu "Edit theme colours"), they will be saved for future sheets.
